# Data-Parser

Lightweight bash script that generates an XML file for each legitimate     +state county pair, containing information parsed from a CSV (data made         +available by the US Government). These newly generated XML files can be used to display a subset of the required data on formatted webpages.

Source code is commented thoroughly to increase visibility
